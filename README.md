# Vivaldi Zen Style

**Vivaldi Zen Style** is a custom CSS modification for [Vivaldi Browser] that gives the interface a "Zen Browser-like" aesthetic.

The initial design was taken from https://github.com/MohamedxSalah/Vivaldi-Air and later changed to be more like Zen Browser.
Feel free to use this whatever you want.

- Auto-hiding Bookmarks Bar: hides the bar when not in use.
- Interactive Main Bar Icons: Icons scale up and glow when hovered over.
- Animated Vivaldi Button: rhythmic "heartbeat" pulse effect.
- Active Tab Highlight: The current tab displays a soft, breathing glow animation.
- Tab Hover Effects: tabs icon zoom and a white glow around the tab shows up when the cursor passes over them.

No JS was used on this.
